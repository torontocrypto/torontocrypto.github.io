A good portion of my last week was figuring out
how to best deliver TorontoCrypto's content. Thankfully, having finally
sat down and spent some time with [RSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS),
we now have two streams of content to add to your RSS stream or reader. If
you are new to the idea of streamlining media, check
out this article on [RSS and how to amalgamate your news](http://webtrends.about.com/od/revie2/tp/Rss-Aggregator-Tools-Combine-Rss-Feeds.htm).

* [TorontoCrypto's Tweets](https://script.googleusercontent.com/macros/echo?user_content_key=qw-XxbwW2tzdCjg5fl22SMM9acF8Ywq1_rLXugjT59pb11jw8M1Dy93EVWhtd9chDs1AKFuFCOPAE7KAy-8TdZhF0iB7-Qgtm5_BxDlH2jW0nuo2oDemN9CCS2h10ox_1xSncGQajx_ryfhECjZEnFJHYw77UeOYuB9cXkblg4EdBIbM_q4d5yzGRI5e_jhJTG50aC6L28TXH_kIX9fqPI8UW_efKYelPxRHsKKEc6K4f5s4Ovbbm--IeOBjrGdl&lib=M398XYW3Ay3Lvxjy6-1ouXaeUUI5sxUYT

We've also added the [CCLA](http://ccla.org/), [OpenMedia](https://openmedia.ca/)
and [Hacklab](https://hacklab.to/) streams
to our Twitter as we respect these organizations immensely.

Bill C-51 pending, this Summer already has plenty of great things in store
for privacy in Toronto!
