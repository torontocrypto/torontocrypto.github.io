No. We will provide the technology that is used at this CryptoParty.
Bring a notepad and pen/pencil, though!

Absolutely! It is our job as an organization to break all barriers
involved with explaining personal security.

#### New mentors are welcome!

We’re always looking for new mentors to help out. If you’re familiar with
