CryptoParty is about empowering everyone to take control over their own digital privacy.

CryptoParty represents a movement to demystify the jargon and level the playing field
between those who understand the necessity of personal security and non-technical users.
The difficulty in presenting this paradigm is the divide between security and convenience
as non-technical users would be confused by highly jargonized papers and
inefficient application documentation.

Recently, applications developed by the Open Source community have made leaps in
user experience and design, as easy-to-navigate interfaces for strong
privacy technologies have emerged. CryptoParty is the bridge between
hackers who live security and non-technical users who want the same level of
protection applied to their online/offline activities that was once restricted
to those ‘in the know’.
