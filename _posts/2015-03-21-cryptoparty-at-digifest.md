Toronto Crypto is very pleased to announce that we will
be in attendance for a CryptoParty at [George Brown's Digifest](http://torontodigifest.ca/2015) this year! This
will give us a chance to show off our new CryptoParty
workstations (Tor Browser, Mobile, PGP and File Encryption).
Location of Digifest is the [Corus Quay building](http://www.yelp.ca/biz/corus-quay-toronto), May 9th
starting at 10AM and running until 4pm. We'll be there in full
force and most importantly: Admission is $FREE$!
