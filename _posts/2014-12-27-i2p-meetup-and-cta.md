We're very excited to announce that Toronto Crypto
will be closely working with the I2P team in expanding
the network's reach. Some of us are strong
believers in I2P's fundamentals and believe
that [I2P's wall-garden approach](https://geti2p.net/en/docs/how/intro) arguably makes for a more sustainable
darknet. [Even though some media attention
has drawn attention to the network](http://gizmodo.com/i2p-the-super-anonymous-network-that-silk-road-calls-h-1680940282) as of late I2P
is still vastly unknown by the general populace.

The goal with this I2P initiative is to set a
road map for creating applications and avenues
for people to better interact with the I2P network. We'll
be hosting an event for the I2P crew in the summer so If
you're interested in getting involved, join us on IRC.
