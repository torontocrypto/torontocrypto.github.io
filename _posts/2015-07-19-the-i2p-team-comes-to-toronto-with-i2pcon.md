If you've been [as interested in I2P as we have](https://www.torontocrypto.org/blog/2015/07/09/how-our-irc-chat-bot-helps-you-talk-to-us-anonymously.html) or if
you've been wondering [what alternatives to Tor exist out
there](https://geti2p.net/en/comparison/tor), we're happy to present the answer to your questions with
[I2PCon](https://geti2p.net/en/blog/post/2015/07/16/I2PCon). The I2P team has
been working tirelessly around the clock setting up details for coming
to Toronto. Needless to say, we are completely honored that this revolutionary
darknet technology decided that Toronto is the place to host
their conference and we couldn't be more excited to be a part
of this!

[#I2PCon](https://twitter.com/hashtag/i2pcon) will be a two day, FREE conference on August 15-16 with members of our team presenting CryptoParty style workstations on Day 1 and a superb line-up of speakers on both days. The
itinerary is [listed here](https://geti2p.net/en/blog/post/2015/07/16/I2PCon) and you really should [reserve your
spot at the event](http://www.eventbrite.ca/e/i2p-meetup-tickets-17773984466)! Subscribe to future [I2P details here](https://geti2p.net/en/feed/blog/atom).
We'll see you at the conference. Remember to donate
to Hacklab and I2P while there!
