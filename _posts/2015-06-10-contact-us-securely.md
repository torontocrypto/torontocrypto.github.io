Thanks to our friends at [CryptoPartyAL](https://cryptopartyal.org/) reaching
out I was finally acquainted with [Encrypt.To](https://encrypt.to), a web-mail service
that uses a web contact form and publicly available PGP key. This service allows users with
no prior knowledge of PGP to send encrypted messages to organizations/other users who have keys
listed on public keyservers. I think this is a great idea and I applaud encrypt.to for helping
progress email encryption adoption to non-technical users.

You can now reach us here using our [PGP key](https://pgp.mit.edu/pks/lookup?op=vindex&search=0xC4E3BE42F7C7BFE3).
Best of luck to CryptoPartyATL on their first (but not last!) [CryptoParty](/cryptoparty).
