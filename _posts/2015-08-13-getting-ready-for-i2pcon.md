[I2PCon](https://geti2p.net/en/comparison/tor) is near (I've heard we might
even be at max already ;D) and to get ourselves prepared for a great
weekend, Toronto Crypto has gone ahead and implemented
two solutions utilizing I2P technology. [We've established our eepsite in the I2P
network](http://3lgja7nllx23pxisb24s2xah5qtmyb6hbouqzccus5imzobwga7a.b32.i2p/) and
have been busy working on our first CryptoStation. These
stations will be applications that we will be giving out so
other organizations can work on their own cryptoparties (in
the hopes of everyone [having more Crypto Parties!](https://www.cryptoparty.in/parties/howto))

This CryptoStation is called Secure Identities with I2P-Bote.
This station is a VirtualBox appliance that can be deployed
quickly to send secure, anonymous messages over the I2P network.
Download [this torrent](/files/tcp_i2p_appliance.torrent) and dive
right in - documentation is included to help with install and configuration.

Thank you, see you at [Hacklab](https://hacklab.to)!
