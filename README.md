TorontoCrypto
=====

TorontoCrypto was Ontario's premier non-profit privacy advocacy
operating between 2011 and 2018. TorontoCrypto amalgamated the best
and brightest in local hacking talent to help propel regional understanding
of the international data privacy movement. The slated goal of TorontoCrypto
was to heighten local interest in data privacy and combine
community-outreach events with applications usable by
a non-technical crowd. To achieve this TorontoCrypto facilitated events,
such as Cryptoparties and privacy oriented conferences,
as well as created applications and solutions for both members
and the community.

TorontoCrypto's leadership decided to officially call for the end
of the organization in 2018 as the members decided that the organization's
goal **was successful**. Members hold positions in large organizations, some of
which are on the Fortune 500, as well as other industry changing organizations. Through
these connections TorontoCrypto members are positioned to better steer public and
industry opinion on data privacy beyond what was possible with TorontoCrypto.
